Virtualmin PHP API
===================

Starting to write an OO Virtualmin library in PHP. The aim is to allow full
management of a Virtualmin server through a set of PHP classes. Starting off
with minimal features but plan to expand it (and contributions welcome).

Requirements

* PHP 5.4
* Guzzle HTTP Client
